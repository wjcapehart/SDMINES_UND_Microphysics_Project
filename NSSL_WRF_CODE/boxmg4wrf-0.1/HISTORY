HISTORY:                                           boxmg-mpi-0.5.0 (2006/07/12)
===============================================================================

boxmg-0.5.0 (2006/07/12)
   - added copyright notice (COPYRIGHT) and LGPL license file (LICENSE).
   - added support for Itanium (Linux-ia64) and Opteron (Linux-AMD64)
     based machines.  
   - fixed a bug in BMG2_SymStd_SOLVE_boxmg that left some dimensions 
     uninitialized when skipping the setup (e.g., NBMG_iWORK_CS). 
   - fixed a bug in the specification of the loop boundaries in
     the copy of BBD -> Q for the case of NProcI=1 or NProcJ=1
   - fixed a bug in (3D) ncycle (call to residual with args out of order)
   - In BMG2_SymStd_SOLVE_pcg KF was uninitialized and is equivalent
     to NOG in this case: KF->NOG in residual and matvec calls.

     (Classification Review #:LA-CC-04-070)

boxmg-mpi-0.5.0-pre1 (2004/04/27)
   - fixed the divide by zero issue in the calculation of the
     relative residual in BMG2_*SOLVE_pcg and BMG2_*SOLVE_boxmg.
   - reorganized the code to include boxmg-extras-mpi within the boxmg-mpi
     package as the subdirectory extras.  This change is intended to 
     make building boxmg more convenient for users, and it will make
     the pending move to GNU Autotools much easier.
   - added support for the Portland Group compilers
   - updated the boxmg-serial distribution to version 1.6.4.
   - updated the interpolation operators to be consistent with the
     current serial distribution.
   - resync'd parameter definitions with the serial.  In particular,
     new options were added for the coarse-grid construction method
     and for the coarse-grid operator type. (Note: the options don't
     actual do anything yet).
   - new error checking for 2D and 3D parallel.  This required 
     changes to the *SETUP_PtrWork argument list.  There is still
     more work required here, but at least the user can now check
     the error code returned by BoxMG. 
   - added the option to use the serial BoxMG code for the coarse-grid
     solve in 2D (this was already supported in 3D).  This feature
     required changes to BMG2_SymStd_SOLVE_boxmg argument list and
     new input files for the tests.
   - added the block-local construction option for constructing the
     coarse-grid operators in 2D.
   - a few improvements were made to the line relaxation:
        * fixed a bug in the memory allocation
        * fixed a bug in the computation of workspace pointers 
          for the interface system (i.e., in BMG2_SymStd_LineSolve_B).
        * fixed the level and processor dependent logic for the
          red-black ordering of the line relaxation sweeps. This
          ordering is consistent with the serial code.
        * along the lines the communication is based on MPI_GATHER
          and MPI_SCATTER, providing the update to ghost points.
        * transverse to the lines the option is now available to
	  choose the communication model based on either our standard
	  MSG communication of all ghost cells, or the selective 
          communication of only information that has changed.
    - some miscellaneous internal cleanup and elmination of unused code.
    - updated the two-dimensional tests (all run now) including
      ex_direct_1_f90, which is taken directly from the Q-milestone.

boxmg-mpi-0.4.0 (2003/09/26)
   - both 2D and 3D codes run now, reproducing the serial results
     in most examples (no plane relaxation in 3D).
   - added the PCG routines for the 3D.
   - completed transition to the BMG[23] namespace convention.
   - added the option for either gather-scatter or allgather communication
     with the coarse-grid solve (gather-scatter is the default).
   - added the option to update the ghost unknowns for the initial
     guess in BMG[23]_SymStd_SOLVE_boxmg
   - eliminated communication in the setup of the MSG communicators.
     (a level dependend number of allgathers) 
   - switched BMG_timer calls to MPI_Wtime.
   - added collection of verbose timing information and created
     the BMG[23]_SymStd_OUTPUT_times subroutines.
   - fixed the space estimate for NMSGr to eliminate Nproc**2 dependence.
   - added the option of using the serial BoxMG as the coarse-grid
     solver, instead of ILU (3D only).
   - updated the main 3D examples, ex_direct_1 and ex_direct_pcg, to 
     read data from the three files given in FileList*, which is
     intended to be redirected from standard in.
   - added BMG[23]_SymStd_SETUP_ProcGrid_file, which reads processor-grid
     data from a file and then setups the BMG_MPI_iGRID data array.
     Consistency required a number of interface changes, including the
     main solver interface to BMG[23]_SymStd_SOLVE_boxmg.
   - eliminated the misleading parameter MaxNumProc.
   - standardized the meaning of MyProc and related variables throughout.
     Default internal to boxmg is the MSG numbering (1,...,NProc), 
     when ambiguity may exist we use either MPI_MyProc or MSG_MyProc.
   - eliminated the post solve communication from BMG2_SymStd_SOLVE_cg.
   - sync'd many updates in from the serial code, particuarly relating
     to the 3D plane relaxation and the build system.
   - improved flexibility of our MSG communication patterns to
     accomodate the asymmetric and dual-grid patterns arising in the 
     coarse-grid operator construction.
   - fixed GS relaxation, which is now a true 8-color relaxation for
     27-point operators (it was 4-color).
   - added BMG[23]_SymStd_DUMP* routines for the stencil, restriction
     and interpolation operators.  The option is included to examine
     these operators interactively, or to dump this data to a file.

boxmg-mpi-0.3.1 (2003/08/05) 
   - updates to PCG routines and minor changes to this interface.
   - fixed minor bug in workspace computation and added the option
     to return the dimensions of the required workspace arrays.
   - include files have been sync'd (as much as possible) with 
     the serial version.  Also, dual continuation characters have
     been added to make these files f90 compatible.
   - a few name space improvements, but lots still left to do here.
   - no measureable progress on 3D yet.

boxmg-mpi-0.3.0 (2003/07/17)
   - added PCG routines
   - added examples: ex_direct_aniso, ex_direct_poission
   - permit explicit workspace calculation in BMG2_SymStd_SETUP_PtrWork.f
   - fixed issues with number of grids/levels = 1
   - name space improvements, most notably boxmg -> BMG2_SymStd_SOLVE_boxmg
     so users must update calls.  In addition X-line and Y-line
     communicators were added to the argument list.
   - development of 3D is ongoing, it's not working yet!

boxmg-mpi-0.2.0 (2002/02/08)
   - first signs of success: 2D with colored Gauss-Seidel relaxation works.
   - a very limited test case resides in src/boxmg-sym-std-2D
   - tests and 3D have not been updated

boxmg-mpi-0.1.0 (2000/13/03)
   - includes boxmg-1.4.0 (the serial version) and an example 
     of a parallel preconditioned CG iteration that uses boxmg
     locally as a preconditioner.
