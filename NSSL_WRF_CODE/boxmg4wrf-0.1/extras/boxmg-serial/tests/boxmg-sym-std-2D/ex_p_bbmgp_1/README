                    sposl.f     (not needed for boxmg, bbmg)
                    xerabt.f
                    xerctl.f
                    xerprt.f

                    xersav.f
                    xgetua.f

SLATEC routines:   xermsg     (see below about dummy routines)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dummy routines:   timer.f     This routine should call the system timer that
                              your computer has, if available. This routine
                              can also be left as a null routine.
                              (Currently it contains a call to the timer for
                              the Sequent available at CU-Denver.)

                  xermsg.f    This routine is a from the SLATEC subroutine
                              math library. If you have the current version
                              of the SLATEC library then xermsg should be
                              available to you. If you don't, then you can
                              either make a call to some other error message
                              handler or leave this as a null routine.


-------------------------- EXAMPLES ------------------------------------

Example EX1.BBMG:   main.f
                    putf.f
                    diff.f
                    output

Example EX2.BBMG:   main.f
                    putf.f
                    pcoef.f
                    esol.f
                    output

Example EX1.BBMGP:   main.f
                     putf.f
                     normal.f
                     checker.f
                     exsoln.f
                     output

Example EX1.DIVMG:   main.f
                     coef.f
                     output

==============================================================================

You should now have the above files. These files may be split into thier
individual components by using the UNIX command 'fsplit filename'.
You will notice that there are a few routines in common between BOXMG 
and BOXMGP, these routines are indeed the same and need not be duplicated,
but have been included in each shipping.

The driver interface routines are shipped separate in one file together.

The documentation for the drivers si located in the headers to the codes
BBMG.F, BBMGP.F, and DIVMG.F the original documentation for the solvers
is still located in the headers to those files, BOXMG.F and BOXMGP.F

The examples have both the code and the resulting output.

PORTING: The code should be fairly portable and has executed successfully
in the present form on several computers under UNIX, ULTRIX, and VMS.
You need to make sure that the library routine R1MACH.F is set to your
computers values. Also you should correct the call in TIMER.F to your
computers timing clock.
As usual you may have to fiddle with the I/O (e.g. write) statements inorder
to obtain output from the code. The I/O unit is set to '*' in the codes so
that the default I/O unit will be used.
Note: that the majority of the testing and the current configuration are
for UNIX 4.2BSD

Feel free to distribute this code, but it can not be sold, or have the
copyright tag and authorship removed from it.

Any feedback on this package would be appreciated, also I would be very
interested in recieving any 'test/example' codes that you create (the form
that it is in is not that important as long as I know what the problem and
the domain is that are being used.)
Thanks.
