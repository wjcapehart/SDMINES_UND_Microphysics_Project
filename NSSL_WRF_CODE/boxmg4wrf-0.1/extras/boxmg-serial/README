         Black Box Multigrid for (2D and 3D) Symmetric Problems


     This package contains an updated version of Black Box Multigrid
  for symmetric 2D problems [1,2] that is written in Fortran 77 and
  has been tested on a wide variety of machines.  The codes are
  suitable for 9-point discretizations of elliptic PDEs.  Specifically
  there are two versions of Black Box Multigrid for 2D problems in
  this package.  The first, which is dicussed in detail in [1], is
  suitable for 9-point discretizations of elliptic PDEs with
  combinations of Dirichlet, Neumann and Robin boundary conditions
  (i.e., positive definite matrices).  The second [2], accomodates
  9-point discretizations of elliptic PDEs that generate a
  semi-definite matrix (e.g., periodic boundary conditions).  In both
  cases the user is only required to provide the fine-grid stencil,
  the discrete right hand side and an initial guess. The code
  generates all coarse-grid and intergrid transfer operators.

     Also this package contains a version of Black Box Multigrid for
  symmetric 3D problems [3] that hasn't been tested much yet.  It was
  developed on the CRAY-YMP, and its implementation has been updated
  significantly here to include the true  variationally coarse-grid
  operators and more efficient plane relaxation.  It is suitable
  for 7-, 15- and 27-point discretizations of second order
  self-adjoint elliptic PDEs on logically rectangular grids (e.g.,
  tensor product grids).  It is possible to treat both vertex- and
  cell-based discretizations provided the underlying structure is
  consistent with a logically rectangular grid.

     There should be very little trouble in porting this set of codes
  to differnt platforms.  Current configuration includes Linux/Intel
  (ia32/ia64 and AMD64) Linux/Alpha, IRIX/R10K and Solaris/UltraSparc.

 History, Contributions, and Collaborations:
----------------------------------------------

  We think this qualifies as "legacy" code, at least it was when we
  dusted it off and started refactoring it in preparation for an
  MPI-based parallel version (which is also available under the LGPL
  license).  First, its safe to say that Joel Dendy wrote the vast
  majority of the original code, and most of these core computational
  elements have been preserved here.  The two-dimensional legacy
  version was prepared for submission to the SLATEC library by
  M. Voytko, but this doesn't appear to have succeeded.  Victor Bandy
  created drivers for this version while at CU Denver in the early
  1990's, and he posted this on www.mgnet.org.

  The refactoring and recent development (1999-2004) was done by David
  Moulton, Markus Berndt, Joel Dendy, and Travis Austin.  The code has
  been used by a growing number of our collaborators, including Scott
  MacLachlan and Dhavide Aruliah, who also kindly reported a bug, or
  three.  We hope more people will find it useful in the future.  If
  there are features you need let us know, it may be possible to add 
  them. 

----------------------------------------------
 NonSymmetric BoxMG:
----------------------------------------------

  Are you interested in a nonsymmetric version of these codes?  If so,
  feel free to contact us! There are a couple of versions around and
  with enough motivation (and time) we should be able to get them
  released under the LGPL as well.  For example, Victor Bandy's thesis
  work ultimately involved nonsymmetric versions of Joel's
  NonSymmetric BoxMG solver. So it's possible that these codes or
  their immediate predecessors could be dusted off and refactored for
  release.
