RAND ->  BMG_RAND

This directory contains the random number generator, RAND, from the
SLATEC Library written by W. Fullerton.  Below you will find the
contents of the original readme file from the SLATEC Common
Mathematical Library, and Section 4 from the Guide notes that this
software is in the public domain.  The software is available on netlib

http://www.netlib.org/slatec/fnlib/rand.f

Here we have modified the function to be REAL*8, and to avoid naming
conflicts we've renamed it BMG_RAND.
