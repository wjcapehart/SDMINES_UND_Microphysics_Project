i1mach.f, d1mach.f

This directory contains machine constants definition subroutines
from SLATEC Library written by Fox et al.  Below you will find the
contents of the original readme file from the SLATEC Common
Mathematical Library, and Section 4 from the Guide notes that this
software is in the public domain.  The software is available on netlib

http://www.netlib.org/slatec/fnlib/rand.f

We have modified these files accordingly for these newer systems. Yes,
this process is crufty, and we do plan on updating this whole tree
someday, as these constants are not used in any serious way by BoxMG.

BMG_timer.f

Our own machine specific timer routine.  This has the same LGPL
license as the main library (refer to the source code or to
the top-level LICENSE file).
